# Tutorial to create Styling components using Sass.


### Step 1: Pull the Git code from github

Please find the following commands to load sass-update branch in your local repository.

`
	git init
	git remote add origin https://github.com/rmanojcse06/react-web.git
	git fetch
	git checkout origin/sass-update
`

### Step 2: Load as a node.js project

Initialize a node project using the following command
> npm init
 
Load node_modules using the following command
> npm install

Once all the modules are loaded, Type the following command
> npx run webpack 




 ### Step 9: Start the application
 
 Now you can run the html page using `webpack-dev-server` which can be done using the following command.
 
 > npx webpack serve --mode development --open --hot --port 8085

 So, that application will be running on localhost:8085 port.
