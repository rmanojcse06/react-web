# Tutorial to create Styling components using Sass.

### Step 1: Add sass loader with the `webpack.config.js`




> npx run webpack 

If you got any error then wait till entry point and files are been created.




 ### Step 9: Start the application
 
 Now you can run the html page using `webpack-dev-server` which can be done using the following command.
 
 > npx webpack serve --mode development --open --hot --port 8085

 So, that application will be running on localhost:8085 port.
